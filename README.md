# 1. Inventory Management System

This Python program processes sales orders for products in an inventory and updates stock levels accordingly. It generates restock alerts if a product's stock falls below a specified minimum after processing an order.

## solution overview
The program takes two lists:

Products: Each product has a unique ID, a name, and a current stock level.
Sales Orders: Each order specifies the product ID and the quantity ordered.
The process_orders function does the following:

* Maps each product by its ID for quick lookup.

* Processes each sales order by checking if there is enough stock to fulfill the order.

* If there is sufficient stock, the stock is reduced by the order quantity, and the system marks the order as successful.
* If the stock is insufficient, the system reports a failure for that order.
* After processing each order, the system checks if any productâ€™s stock falls below a predefined minimum stock level (assumed to be 10 in this case). If so, it generates a restock alert for that product.
## Assumption made

* Product Availability: It is assumed that all products  listed in the sales orders exist in the product list. If a product is not found in the inventory, the system will skip that order and report that the product does not exist.
* Stock Management: The stock levels are updated only if the order can be completely fulfilled. Partial order fulfillment is not considered.
* Minimum Stock Threshold: The minimum stock level required to trigger a restock alert is set to 10. This can be adjusted as needed.
* Product Identification: Products are identified by their unique ID. There is no handling for orders that refer to products by name or other attributes.
## How program work

Prerequisites:

Ensure that Python is installed on your system. The code is written for Python 3.x.

Steps:

* step 1: Clone or download the script to your local machine.
* step 2: Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the "inventory_management.py" file.


* step 3: type " python inventory_management.py" on cmd 
Expected Output:

The script will print the status of each order, whether it was successful or not.
It will also print a list of products that require restocking if their stock falls below the minimum threshold.

## Conclusion

This program provides a basic solution for processing sales orders and managing stock levels in an inventory. The code can be extended to include more sophisticated features, such as handling partial orders, automatic restocking, or integrating with a database for persistent storage.
# 2. E-commerce Database Management System

This project implements a simple e-commerce database system that manages users, products, orders, and payments. The system models relationships between these entities using a relational database schema, as depicted in the ER diagram, and provides functionality for processing user orders and payments.


## Database Entities

* User: Stores user information such as username, password, and email.

* Product: Holds product details like name, category, price, and stock levels.

* Order: Manages the details of customer orders, including the total price, status, and date of the order.

* OrderProduct: Represents the many-to-many relationship between orders and products. Each order can contain multiple products, and each product can appear in multiple orders.

* Payment: Tracks payment details, including the payment method, order ID, and payment amount.
## Key Relationships

* A User can place multiple Orders.

* An Order can contain multiple Products, and each product can appear in different orders (via the OrderProduct junction table).

* Payments are linked to a specific Order.
# 3. Bookstore Sales Analysis Queries

This project includes a set of SQL queries to analyze the sales data of a bookstore, focusing on total revenue by author, book orders, and identifying top customers over the past year.
## 1. Calculate Total Revenue by Author

This query calculates the total revenue generated by each author based on the quantity of books ordered and their prices.

EXPLANATION
* We are joining the book and orderdetails tables using the book_id to link the two.

* We then sum the product of quantity and price for each author to get the total revenue.

* The results are grouped by the author's name.
## 2. Find Books Ordered More Than 10 Times

This query finds the books that have been ordered more than 10 times, showing the total quantity ordered for each book.

SELECT book.title, SUM(orderdetails.quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM book
JOIN orderdetails ON book.book_id = orderdetails.book_id
GROUP BY book.title
HAVING SUM(orderdetails.quantity) > 10;

## 

```sql
SELECT book.title, SUM(orderdetails.quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM book
JOIN orderdetails ON book.book_id = orderdetails.book_id
GROUP BY book.title
HAVING SUM(orderdetails.quantity) > 10;

```

EXPLANATION

* We are again joining the book and orderdetails tables by book_id.
* We use GROUP BY to get the sum of the ordered quantities for each book.
* The HAVING clause ensures only books with more than 10 total orders are displayed.


## 3. Top 5 Customers by Book Purchases (Last Year)

This query retrieves the top 5 customers who purchased the most books in the last year.

```
SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.name, SUM(OrderDetails.quantity) AS total_books
FROM Orders
JOIN Customers ON Orders.customer_id = Customers.customer_id
JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.order_id = OrderDetails.order_id
WHERE Orders.order_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR  -- Last 1 year
GROUP BY Customers.customer_id, Customers.name
ORDER BY total_books DESC
LIMIT 5;

```

EXPLANATION

* We are joining the Orders, Customers, and OrderDetails tables to get customer details and their order quantities.

* The WHERE clause filters orders from the last year using NOW() and INTERVAL 1 YEAR.

* The GROUP BY groups the result by customer, and ORDER BY total_books DESC orders them by the number of books purchased, in descending order.

* The LIMIT 5 ensures only the top 5 customers are shown.
